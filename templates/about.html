His drive and passion are not something you see everyday. He takes every advice in consideration, thinks about it, works on it, does his research, and comes back with his own approach on the subject. If you ask me, that's the best kind of learning. It's truly an honour to be a part of his journey, and I can't wait to see where it leads him. Somewhere amazing, I'm sure."</p>
