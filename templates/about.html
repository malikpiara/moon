                        <p>My name is Malik and I dream and fight for a world where anyone can have the freedom to decide who they want to be and what they want to pursue.</p>

                        <p>Moonwith is my digital home. The place where I share my thoughts on personal growth, emotional intelligence and product management.</p>
                        
                        <p>As of October 2021, I'm focused on learning more about Climate Science and Social Psychology. And I'm borrowing ideas and mental models from Socrates and Aristotle to apply them in decision making.

Keep pushing forward!"</p>

His drive and passion are not something you see everyday. He takes every advice in consideration, thinks about it, works on it, does his research, and comes back with his own approach on the subject. If you ask me, that's the best kind of learning. It's truly an honour to be a part of his journey, and I can't wait to see where it leads him. Somewhere amazing, I'm sure."</p>
