Social circles can be a source of comfort, support, fulfilment and growth. As someone who builds communities, I’m aware of the compounding advantages that come with being part of an additional circle. We have more people to learn with. More access to opportunities. A richer perspective of the world. And more protection when things go wrong. — But I’m also aware of the difficulty of accessing new circles and maintaining strong connections over long periods of time. Most of us are part of less than 4 social circles. And our ability to influence them is often limited: It's easier to find a new employer, university or religion than it is to try and change the culture that defines them. But that’s not the case with family.

Families are institutions over which we can have a higher degree of agency. They are not cohesive by default but we can shape them with time and patience. Regardless of how we might feel about our relatives, they’ll always be part of our life. It makes sense to invest time and energy building close bonds and cultivating a wiser, wealthier and more educated environment because doing so generates a virtuous cycle and makes everyone better off in the long-term.

Looking at the future, I can only hope that my kids grow up with a high sense of belonging and self-esteem that often comes with being part of inclusive social circles early on. And I know that in order to achieve that, I have to start doing the work today.
